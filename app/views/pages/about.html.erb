<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries, we realized that the typical
  product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely
  communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails
  to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
<hr>
  For this reason, we decided to utilize a completely different development parttern that focuses on highly
  focused communication and transparent design patterns. When we take on a project not only do we work
  to craft the application to the client's specifications, we give daily updates to ensure that the project
  is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time,
  and on budget.
